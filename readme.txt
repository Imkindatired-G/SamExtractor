IMPORTANT:

I don't take credit for the calculations done in samviewer.py (or samviewer.py in its entirety) to decrypt the collected hashes or the copying of the registry hives made possible through RawCopy. My contribution is just allowing for the automated collection and display of decrypted password hashes on a live system.

samviewer.py and utils.py is from Andrew Endermanch on GitHub (https://github.com/endermanch) specifically, https://github.com/Endermanch/scripts
